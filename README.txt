Spring based webpage, where people can buy and sell recycled products (PA, PVC etc.). There is possibility to register as a regular user, but also as a company or delivery company. Users can add new offers with products and details, browse available offers, filter and sort them. There is user panel to add user's company and edit user's details. Every user has its own shopping cart to store several products which can later be bought. The project is currently updated.

TO TEST THIS PROJECT, USE IntelliJ Ultimate and also create database called "buyrecycle" and edit application.properties properly.
